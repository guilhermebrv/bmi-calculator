# Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator

This project marks a significant milestone in my journey through the ["iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp) taught by Angela Yu on Udemy. As part of this course module, I successfully developed a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that delivers some not-so-serious health recommendations based on user weight and height.

## Key Features

- **Interactive UI Sliders:** Implemented dynamic UI sliders to allow users to observe real-time updates of weight and height values, fostering an engaging in an interactive calculation experience.

- **Streamlined Navigation:** Incorporated the navigation controller to facilitate seamless transitions between the calculation screen and result screen, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **MVVM Design Pattern with ViewCode:** Transformed the project architecture to adhere to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern using ViewCode. Although it is a short and not so complex project, this adaptation from the initial MVC (Model-View-Controller) and Storyboard structure in the course's project sketch resulted in a more organized and modular codebase.
  
## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guilhermebrv/bmi-calculator.git

2. **Open in Xcode:**
- Launch the project in Xcode and run it on your preferred iOS simulator or device.

3. **Explore and Calculate:**
- Utilize the interactive UI sliders to input weight and height.
- Navigate through both screens using the implemented navigation controller.
- Receive personalized health advice based on your calculated BMI - nothing too serious, just a lighthearted touch!
